#Mycode
I am learning pyhton. This repo is going to be how I learn to code like a robot.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We don't have any, so just make a note that they are none at this time.

## Deployment

I will be testing my code within Linux Ubuntu. 

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used, "and my mitts." -Marv

## Contributing

I will be learning a lot for our teacher, a spry young fellow goes by the name Zach. I'm sure my fellow classmates will contribute much. But star of teh show will be good ol Gunny Goolge.
